# MatrixReconstruct
Code used in my bachelor thesis project.

Contains a file where all kinds of different useful functions are stored called AllFunctions.py (not necessary to generate plots)
The other file is used to generate the results in my thesis. For this, seed 1 has been used. You can change the seed and get different but similar results.
